# Make me a basic HTML contact form that has the following fields:

1. Firstname
2. Lastname
3. Birthdate
4. Favorite Number
5. Phone Number
6. Email
7. Message
8. Submit and Reset buttons

Must have:

1. The correct HTML semantics
   a. use the correct html tag / elements
   b. use the appropriate attributes and their values (if needed) for each of these tags / elements for the input types
2. Build the index.html where the form is
3. Doesnâ€™t have to successfully submit the form anywhere by Monday (the due date)
4. The form must reset when the reset button is there
5. No input validations yet (follow up homework on top of this)
6. No need to design with CSS yet (follow up homework on top of this, maybe)
7. Understand how to get the values so that when you submit, you can console.log them --- remember the document.getElementById()
